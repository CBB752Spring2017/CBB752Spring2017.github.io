## About the Course

Biomedical Data Science: Mining and Modeling

-   **Title:** Bioinformatics: Biomedical Data Science: Mining and Modeling

-   **Instructor:** [Gerstein, Mark](<http://www.gersteinlab.org>)

-   **TAs**: Gu, Mengting
-            Muir, Paul

-   **Introduction:** Bioinformatics encompasses the analysis of gene sequences,
    macromolecular structures, and functional genomics data on a large scale. It
    represents a major practical application for modern techniques in data
    mining and simulation. Specific topics to be covered include sequence
    alignment, large-scale processing, next-generation sequencing data,
    comparative genomics, phylogenetics, biological database design, geometric
    analysis of protein structure, molecular-dynamics simulation, biological
    networks, normalization of microarray data, mining of functional genomics
    data sets, and machine-learning approaches to data integration.
