About the Course
------------------
- **Title:** Biomedical Data Science: Mining and Modeling
- **Instructor:** [Mark Gerstein](<http://www.gersteinlab.org>)
- **TAs:** Mengting Gu, Paul Muir
- **Introduction:** Bioinformatics encompasses the analysis of gene sequences,
    macromolecular structures, and functional genomics data on a large scale. It
    represents a major practical application for modern techniques in data
    mining and simulation. Specific topics to be covered include sequence
    alignment, large-scale processing, next-generation sequencing data,
    comparative genomics, phylogenetics, biological database design, geometric
    analysis of protein structure, molecular-dynamics simulation, biological
    networks, normalization of microarray data, mining of functional genomics
    data sets, and machine-learning approaches to data integration.

Final Project
-----------------------

**Due: May 9th 11:59PM**

Students will form teams to work on one of the following topics of interest, though we are open to other potential projects if they are clearly articulated and of comparable scope to these listed below. The submitted final projectsÂ will be published on this website. It will also serve as a reference for later students and researchers.

### Topics

#### Part 1: Comparative analysis of personal genomes:

-1. Identifying SVs in personal genomes.

-2. Calculate how many SNPs are shared among all genomes and how many are person specific.

-3. Intersect each person's SNPs with [HGMD](<http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php>) and identify which are disease associated. Are the shared or specific SNP sets enriched for disease associated SNPs?



#### Part 2: Personal genomes and personalized medicine (CRISPR):
-1. Propose a tool that identifies off target CRISPR sites given a genome and guide RNA sequence.

-2. Propose a tool that finds all PAM sites in the human reference genome as well as a personal genome and compares the similarity of the two sets.

-3. Propose a tool that determines the usefulness of CRISPR-targeted deaminases. How many disease associated SNPs could this technology edit?

-4. Propose a tool that integrates additional genomic information to better predict CRISPR activity (e.g. DNase I hypersensitivity data from ENCODE).



#### Part 3: Network analysis of personal genomes:
-1. Propose a tool that calculates the degree centrality and betweenness centrality of proteins containing and not containing SNPs in the personal genomes using a PPI file.

-2. One of the personal genomes has an accompanying transcriptomic time course. Identify pathways or gene networks whose expression are altered after HRV or RSV infection.



#### Part 4: Structure Analysis
-1. Similar to Assignment 3, but look at structure of mutant type of 3VKO. Look at mutations at location 19: F19Y, F19I, F19L, and compare to the wild type. Perform side chain rotations for these mutant residue at location 19 and calculate the lowest energy conformation for each. 

-2. Similar to Assignment 3, but look at structure of mutant type of 3VKO. Look at mutations at location 35: I35L, I35F, I35V, and compare to the wild type. Perform side chain rotations for these mutant residue at location 35 and calculate the lowest energy conformation for each.
