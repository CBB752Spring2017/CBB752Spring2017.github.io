About the Course
------------------
- **Title:** Biomedical Data Science: Mining and Modeling
- **Instructor:** [Mark Gerstein](<http://www.gersteinlab.org>)
- **TAs:** Mengting Gu, Paul Muir
- **Introduction:** Bioinformatics encompasses the analysis of gene sequences,
    macromolecular structures, and functional genomics data on a large scale. It
    represents a major practical application for modern techniques in data
    mining and simulation. Specific topics to be covered include sequence
    alignment, large-scale processing, next-generation sequencing data,
    comparative genomics, phylogenetics, biological database design, geometric
    analysis of protein structure, molecular-dynamics simulation, biological
    networks, normalization of microarray data, mining of functional genomics
    data sets, and machine-learning approaches to data integration.

Final Project
-----------------------

**Due: May 9th 11:59PM**

Student will form teams to work on one of the following topics of interest, though we are open to other potential projects if they are clearly articulated and of comparable scope to these listed below. The submitted final projectsÂ will be published on this website. It will also serve as a reference for later students and researches.

### Topics

#### Comparative Genomics
Read [Game of Genomes](https://www.statnews.com/feature/game-of-genomes/season-one/). Perform similar analysis on other personal genomes (eg. [Micheal Synder's genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22424236)). Try to start with raw sequencing file, if data available. Otherwise, starts with the BAM file and perform variances calling. Explore the SNVs you find in your VCF file from variances calling, compare the result with Karl Zimmer's genome.


#### CRISPR Design
Design personalized CRISPR gRNA targetting at their protein-coding mutations. Assess the off-target effect of your gRNA and try to assess its effect.

#### Structure Analysis
Check the protein-coding SNPs in Karl Zimmer's genome and Micheal Synder's genome. Look for SNPs that are potentially deleterious (for example, intersecting the SNPs with database like HGMD). What structural changes might have happen due to the mutation that cause phenotypic effect?
