About the Course
------------------
- **Title:** Biomedical Data Science: Mining and Modeling
- **Instructor:** [Mark Gerstein](<http://www.gersteinlab.org>)
- **TAs:** Mengting Gu, Paul Muir
- **Introduction:** Bioinformatics encompasses the analysis of gene sequences,
    macromolecular structures, and functional genomics data on a large scale. It
    represents a major practical application for modern techniques in data
    mining and simulation. Specific topics to be covered include sequence
    alignment, large-scale processing, next-generation sequencing data,
    comparative genomics, phylogenetics, biological database design, geometric
    analysis of protein structure, molecular-dynamics simulation, biological
    networks, normalization of microarray data, mining of functional genomics
    data sets, and machine-learning approaches to data integration.

About the Final Project
-----------------------

- **Why?**

   Instead of generating papers or codes that nobody would ever read (expect for the TAs), we want to encourage the innovative generation of products that could potentially benefit the bioinformatics community.

- **When?**

    Released: April 14th

    Due: May 9th 11:59PM

- **How?**

    Each student will coorporate with classmates to work on three (or four for extra credits) different projects. The generated codes and documents will be published on this website to be resources for later students and researches.

- **What?**

    Project topics are as following. Students can choose three to four favorite projects to work on.
    
### For each sub-project, a group of three people will work on:

1.  **R card**: sample input, source code in R, sample output, and documentation on
    how to execute your code

2.  **Python card**: sample input, source code in Python, sample output, and
    documentation on how to execute your code

3.  **English card**: methodology and background introductory documentation

### Topics
#### Comparative Genomics
1. Read [Game of Genomes](https://www.statnews.com/feature/game-of-genomes/season-one/). Perform similar analysis on other personal genomes (eg. [Micheal Synder's genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22424236))


#### CRISPR Design
1. Design personalized CRISPR gRNA targetting at their protein-coding mutations. Assess the off-target effect of your gRNA and try to assess its effect.

#### Structure Analysis
1. Check the protein-coding SNPs in Karl Zimmer's genome and Micheal Synder's genome. Look for SNPs that are potentially deleterious (for example, intersecting the SNPs with database like HGMD). What structural changes might have happen due to the mutation that cause phenotypic effect?
